Basically a problem where a collection of things are put in a bag/sack.

Sometimes the size of the sack/bag is mentioned. 
Like 50 units can be stored in this bag.

FRACTIONAL KNAPSACK:
Problem where the items to be put into the sack/bag can be divided. 
Eg: sugar, salt, pepper.

0-1 KNAPSACK:
Problem where the item cannot be divided.
It is either put into the bag entirely or not at all.
Eg: Mobile phone, fridge, laptop.  

UNBOUNDED KNAPSACK
Problem where the items can be repeated. Items can be multiplied to fill the bag/sack.
